Read The Docs
=============

Hosting Documentation
---------------------

Documentation can be hosted on a number of websites for free. The primary hosting service is
`ReadTheDocs.org`_ and is fairly straight forward to use. Simply create and account, supply the path to
your repository, then wait for your documentation to be built.

 .. _ReadTheDocs.org: https://readthedocs.org/

 .. note::

    In order to have the documentation automatically update when changes are pushed, to your repository,
    you will need to set up a hook within your repository settings.

ReadTheDocs Sphinx Theme
------------------------

The ReadTheDocs Sphinx Theme is not installed by default with Sphinx, so it must be installed separately.
The documentation walks through the installation process, or use my personal :ref:`ref-workflow`
